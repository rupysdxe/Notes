# Building a Type-Safe Pair Class in Java

## Problem Statement

Many times in software development, we encounter scenarios where we need to return, store, or process pairs of related values. These could be x-y coordinates, key-value pairs, or any two associated pieces of data. A common way to handle this is to use arrays or lists, but these can lack semantic meaning and type safety. Using an array of `Object` can lead to casting issues and runtime errors.

So, how can we create a paired structure that is both meaningful in its usage and type-safe?

## Solution: Generics

Java's Generics feature allows us to define type parameters for classes, interfaces, and methods. By leveraging generics, we can design a type-safe `Pair` class that can hold and manage two related values of potentially different types.

### The Generic Pair Class

```java
public class Pair<V1, V2> {
    private V1 first;
    private V2 second;

    public Pair(V1 first, V2 second) {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
    }

    public V1 getFirst() {
        return first;
    }

    public V2 getSecond() {
        return second;
    }

    public void setFirst(V1 first) {
        this.first = first;
    }

    public void setSecond(V2 second) {
        this.second = second;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Pair{" + "first=" + first + ", second=" + second + '}';
    }
}
```

Usage:

```java
Pair<String, Integer> nameAndAge = new Pair<>("Alice", 30);
Pair<Integer, Integer> point = new Pair<>(10, 20);
```

### Benefits

1. **Type Safety:** Generics ensure compile-time type safety. You won't mistakenly place an incompatible type in a `Pair` without a compile-time warning.

2. **Semantic Meaning:** By using a `Pair` class, the code becomes more expressive and the intention of holding two related values becomes clearer.

3. **Flexibility:** You can use the same `Pair` class to hold and manage any two types of data, making the code more reusable and reducing the need for multiple custom classes.

## Conclusion

Java's Generics mechanism provides an elegant solution for designing type-safe and semantically clear data structures like the `Pair` class. By adopting generics, we can ensure better code clarity, robustness, and maintainability.
