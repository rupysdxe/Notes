# Designing a Generic Storage Class in Java

## Problem Statement

In many software applications, we often face the need to design a storage utility that can store any type of data - whether it's a string, a number, a custom object, or anything else. The naive approach would be to use `Object` as the data type, but this would mean sacrificing type safety. For example, using `Object` can lead to runtime class cast exceptions, if we're not careful. 

How can we design a storage mechanism that is both flexible (can store any type of data) and type-safe?

## Solution: Generics

Java's Generics is a feature that allows type (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces, and methods. By using generics, you can create a single class, method, or interface that can work with different types, while preserving compile-time type safety.

### The Generic Storage Class

```java
public class Storage<T> {
    private T item;

    public Storage() {}

    public Storage(T item) {
        this.item = item;
    }

    public void store(T item) {
        this.item = item;
    }

    public T retrieve() {
        return item;
    }
}
```

With the above generic `Storage` class, we can store any type of data:

```java
Storage<String> stringStorage = new Storage<>();
stringStorage.store("Hello, World!");

Storage<Integer> intStorage = new Storage<>();
intStorage.store(123);

Storage<Person> personStorage = new Storage<>();
personStorage.store(new Person("Alice", 30));
```

### Benefits

1. **Type Safety:** Generics provides compile-time type safety. If you try to store an incompatible type in a `Storage` instance, you'll get a compile-time error, eliminating potential runtime errors.

2. **Code Reusability:** We can use the same `Storage` class to store different types of data. There's no need to create separate storage classes for `String`, `Integer`, or `Person`.

3. **Clearer Code:** The type parameters in generics can make the code more intuitive and easy to understand.

## Conclusion

Java's Generics feature offers a powerful solution for creating type-safe and reusable classes. By using generics, we can create flexible and maintainable code structures, minimizing both redundancy and potential runtime errors.
